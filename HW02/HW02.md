1. Create a Tablet class to model an Android tablet containing the following:
	- Fields: weight(int) screenSize(float) and wifiOnly(boolean)
	- Access to the fields must be through getters and setters only! And they all should be accessible.
	- A default constructor as well as one that initializes the fields.
2. Create a WordTool class that contains the following:
	- a default constructor as well as one that initializes your instance variables
	- a method that counts the number of sentences (separated by . ; ! ?) in a string
	- a method that counts the number of words in a sentence
	- a method that counts the number of characters in a word
	- a method that calculates the frequency of a character per word, sentence, or whole string based on its input
3. Create an ArrayOps class that contains three methods named "avg", "min", and "max". The methods take in an array of ints and return the average, smallest, and largest value respectively. Use ArrayOps in a Demo class's main() function without making an object of it! (Hint: static fields and methods)
